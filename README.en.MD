# Bitcoin address generator

[Ler em portuguÃªs](https://github.com/felipesuri/btc-address-generator/blob/main/README.MD)

This project is a simple bitcoin address generator.

It does not generate an address on the blackchain. This project is only for didactic purposes to learn how addresses are generated.

## How to generate address

```bash
  # Fork this projeto
  git clone https://github.com/felipesuri/btc-address-generator.git

  # Install dependencies
  cd btc-address-generator && yarn

  # Start project
  yarn start

  # The generated data will then be returned to the console.
```

If you want to know if that data is really data that could be used on the blockchain, [click here](www.bitaddress.org), go to "Wallet details" and put the private key in the requested field.
